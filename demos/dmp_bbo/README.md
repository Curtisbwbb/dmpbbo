# Dmp+Bbo demos

## demoOptimizationTask.cpp / demoOptimizationDmpWrapper.py

Demonstrates how to run an evolution strategy to optimize the parameters of a quadratic function, implemented as a Task and TaskSolver.

## demoOptimizationDmp.cpp / demoOptimizationTaskWrapper.py

Demonstrates how to run an evolution strategy to optimize a Dmp.

## demoImitationAndOptimization.cpp

Demonstrates how to initialize a DMP with a trajectory, and then optimize it with an evolution strategy.

## demoOptimizationDmpArm2D.cpp / demoOptimizationDmpArm2DWrapper.py

Demonstrates how to run an evolution strategy to optimize a Dmp, on a task with a viapoint task with a N-DOF arm in a 2D space.
