\ref DMP_BBO

\li demoOptimizationTask.cpp:  Demonstrates how to run an evolution strategy to optimize the parameters of a quadratic function, implemented as a Task and TaskSolver.
\li demoOptimizationDmp.cpp:  Demonstrates how to run an evolution strategy to optimize a Dmp.
\li demoImitationAndOptimization.cpp:  Demonstrates how to initialize a DMP with a trajectory, and then optimize it with an evolution strategy.
\li demoOptimizationDmpArm2D.cpp:  Demonstrates how to run an evolution strategy to optimize a Dmp, on a task with a viapoint task with a N-DOF arm in a 2D space.
