Improve UpdateCovarAdaptation
  allow base_level to be a scale
  add a member max_level (scalar or vector)

Fine tune plotting and include images in tutorial/dmp_bbo_robot.md

Move dmp_bbo_robot up  one directory
  
Make Python scripts robust against missing data, e.g. cost_vars

update Python/C++ comparison

Check if true: An example is given in TaskViapoint, which implements a Task in which the first N columns in cost_vars should represent a N-D trajectory. This convention is respected by TaskSolverDmp, which is able to generate such trajectories.
