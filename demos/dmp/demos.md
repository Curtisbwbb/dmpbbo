# Dmps Demos

## demoDmp.cpp / demoDmpWrapper.py

Demonstrates how to initialize, train and integrate a Dmp.

## demoDmpTrainFromTrajectoryFile.cpp / demoDmpTrainFromTrajectoryFileWrapper.py

Demonstrates how to train a Dmp with a trajectory in a txt file.

## demoDmpChangeGoal.cpp / demoDmpChangeGoalWrapper.py

Demonstrates how to change the goal for a Dmp, and the effects of different scaling approaches.

# Dmp Demos for advanced features 

Here are some demos for advanced Dmp features, which extend the basic Dmp formulation. For more information, see the papers cited in the main README.md.

## demoDmpContextual.cpp / demoDmpContextualWrapper.py

Demonstrates how to initialize, train and integrate a Contextual Dmp.

## demoDmpContextualGoal.cpp / demoDmpContextualGoalWrapper.py

Demonstrates how to initialize, train and integrate a Contextual Dmp that adapts the goal state to the task parameters.

## demoDmpWithGainSchedulesWrapper.cpp / demoDmpWithGainSchedulesWrapper.py

Demonstrates how to initialize, train and integrate a Dmp that also outputs gain schedules alongside the dynamical system.
