Please make sure you have installed all the required packages (cmake, boost and Eigen, see below)
before trying to compile. We assume that you use a compiler that is compatible with the C++11
standard.

To compile, do:
  mkdir -p build_dir; cd build_dir; cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release; make; make Docs

To compile a version that has debugging symbols included, and compiles some tests also:
  mkdir -p build_dir_debug; cd build_dir_debug; cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug; make VERBOSE=1

To install libs in /usr/local/lib, headers in /usr/local/include and binaries in oo_dmp_bbo/bin:
  sudo make install

________________________________________________________________________________    
STATIC VS SHARED LIBRARIES

The default is to build shared libraries, e.g. libdmp.so. Calling "sudo make install" 
will install them in /usr/local/lib. Make sure that /usr/local/lib is in your 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH, or  the binaries will not be able to dynamically link the required 
libraries.

Alternatively, you can build static libraries and link them statically during 
compilation. Just change 
  set(SHARED_OR_STATIC "SHARED") => set(SHARED_OR_STATIC "STATIC")
in CMakeLists.txt in this directory.

INSTALLING REQUIRED/OPTIONAL PACKAGES FOR DEBIAN (UBUNTU) USERS

sudo apt-get install cmake doxygen libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-system-dev libboost-serialization-dev

"sudo apt-get eigen3" currently (February 2014) installs version 3.1.2. However, DmpBbo
requires version >= 3.2. To get the latest Eigen version:
  use this PPA: https://launchpad.net/~kalakris/+archive/eigen
  or do a manual install: see below

MANUAL INSTALLATION OF REQUIRED/OPTIONAL PACKAGES

___________________________________
CMAKE (required)
  http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html	

___________________________________
EIGEN (required, version >= 3.2)
  http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/GettingStarted.html
  Getting the latest version (thanks to Ryan Lober):
		sudo apt-get install mercurial
		"go to whereever you want to start the installation"
		hg clone https://bitbucket.org/eigen/eigen/
		cd eigen
		mkdir build_dir
		cd build_dir
		cmake ..
  	sudo make install
  	
___________________________________
BOOST (required modules: filesystem, system, serialization. version >=1.34) 
  http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_55_0/more/getting_started/
  http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_55_0/libs/filesystem/doc/
  http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_55_0/libs/system/doc/
  http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_55_0/libs/serialization/doc/ 
  	
___________________________________
DOXYGEN (optional, version >1.7.5, for the \cite command)
  http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html#srcbin

___________________________________
LWPR (optional)
  
To use the Locally Weighted Projection Regression algorithm as a 
function approximator, install the following software:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/lwpr/
Our build system assumes the resulting headers/libraries are installed in 
/usr/local/include and /usr/local/lib respectively. If they are in a 
non-standard location (because you don't want to 'make install' or such) 
please modify the following lines in src/functionapproximators/FindLWPR.cmake
accordingly: 
  find_path(LWPR_INCLUDE_DIR lwpr.hh HINTS /usr/local/include/)
  find_library(LWPR_LIBRARY liblwpr.a HINTS /usr/local/lib/)
