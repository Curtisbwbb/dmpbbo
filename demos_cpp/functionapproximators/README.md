# FunctionApproximators Demos

## demoLeastSquares.cpp / demoLeastSquaresWrapper.py

Demonstrates how to run least squares regression.

The executables reads the files inputs.txt, targets.txt and weights.txt from a directory, and runs (weighted) least squares. Parameters to the executable and Python script are the regularization constant, whether the line can have an intercept with the y-axis, and the directory to read the files from. Call the Python script with --help for more information.

## demoFunctionApproximatorTraining.cpp / demoFunctionApproximatorTrainingWrapper.py

Demonstrates how to train all functionapproximators with 1D and 2D data. The Python wrapper additionaly plots the results.
